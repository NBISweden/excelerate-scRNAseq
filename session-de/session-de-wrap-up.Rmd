## Learning objectives
- identify factors in the scRNA-seq workflow connected to differential expression
- assess how filtering and missing data imputations affect differential expresson results
- identify resoures to learn more about differential expression


-------


## Bigger picture


## Live-coding
_Idea: add a small example of looking at the data, distributions, number of zeros, boxplots comparisons of selected genes_

---------

## ToDo 
_working notes, not part of the tutorial, will be removed_
- improve the session
