Differential expression
================

# Common methods

## Learning objectives

  - describe main classes of methods used and reasons behind
  - understand statistical concepts behind the key scRNA-seq DE methods
  - run the key scRNA-seq DE methods

-----

## Main classes

## Under the hood

#### MAST

#### SCDE

#### Monocole

## Live-coding

*Idea: add a small example of looking at the data, distributions, number
of zeros, boxplots comparisons of selected genes*

-----

## ToDo

*working notes, not part of the tutorial, will be removed*
